UDUVUDU
=======

Uduvudu aims to be an easy to use **extensible** and **adaptive** RDF visualization library.

Current State
-------------
Please consider this project right now in alpha stage. There is no release available.

Prerequisites
-------------
The code is currently based on rdfstore-js, handlebars and underscore. The demo uses bootstrap for a basic design.

Currently it works only with a fixed version of the [rdfstore-js](https://raw2.github.com/l00mi/rdfstore-js/master/dist/browser/rdf_store.js "rdf_store.js") which needs to be checked out aside this project or put manualy into the lib folder.


Running the included demo
-------------------------
To make it possible to grab external content from the demo page you need to disable cross-site scripting security in your browser. Then open the index.html in your browser.
